       <p>This recipe is for a breakfast burrito that is made using more traditional Mexican ingredients rather than simply throwing breakfast foods into a tortilla.</p>
       <p>Not only is this recipe closer to a traditional burrito; the tortilla also has the perfect amount of browning and crispiness to it.</p>
