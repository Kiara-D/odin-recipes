# odin-recipes
My project submission for the Odin Project's Recipes project found on the 'Foundations' section.

By doing this project, I will have demonstrated the use of HTML boilerplate and basic HTML elements, as well as improving my abilities to use Git, write out a good commit message, and using Github.
